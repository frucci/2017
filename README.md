## 2017

Hello everyone,

my name is Federico and I am a Data Scientist.

### Welcome to my GitHub.

This is my archive regarding some works I've done during 2017. 

I code in R and Python.

I will not upload everything. I'll update this repository uploading small guides and examples regarding what I'm currently doing and I promise you I'll try to keep this repo as much as possible updated.
