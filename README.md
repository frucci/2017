## 2017

Hello everyone,

my name is Federico and I am a Data Scientist.

### Welcome to my GitHub.

This is my archive regarding some works I've done during 2017. 

I code in R and Python.

I'll update this repository with small guides and examples. I promise you I'll try to keep this repo as much as possible updated.
